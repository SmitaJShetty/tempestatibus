# tempestatibus

A simple application that fetches weather forecasts and other data. Written in nodejs , it uses a third party api - OpenWeatherAPI, to service weather data. Uses a simple in memory caching mechanism that invalidates and replenishes data every day. Also contains one handler that does not use cache.
